# profile-card web Design
## introduction
This repository contains the code for a web-based profile card that i am developping. The goal is to create a simple and visually appealing interface to display personal information.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a simple and aesthetic web profile card, using only HTML and CSS. This card will allow users to present their personal information, such as their profile picture, while offering a responsive and attractive design.
this project will also serve as an exercise to strenghten my front-end development skills, with a focus on HTML structure and CSS styling.
